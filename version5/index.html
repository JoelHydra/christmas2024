            To whomever this message will be read by, if you are reading this, I have met my untimely demise. As fate decided, I have forfeited my final years; in return, I am allowed to pave the way for your survival.
<br>
<br>
In the past few years, I investigated Sakura Imaginations: Moonlit Solutions. Beneath the surface, they researched biotechnology, neurotechnology, and quantum entanglement for real-world applications, but a more sinister plot lurked beneath their waters.
<br>
<br>
Their ambitions reached far beyond the limits of our world, and a sense of dread settled within my heart. The shuddering of my soul grew louder the deeper I ventured. Before reaching the end, the company discovered my actions, and I was caught trying to extract classified files regarding their operations.
<br>
<br>
As security flooded the room, they attempted to capture me. I quickly pulled the hard drive containing the downloaded files from their command terminal and turned to escape. Although I managed to flee successfully, it turns out they had precautions in place, and unbeknownst to me, I began to disappear.
<br>
<br>
As I write this, half of my body has already vanished. Although my health remains unaffected, I sense it won’t be long before I completely disappear.
<br>
<br>
Despite the impending doom, I remain hopeful because I designed a trail of breadcrumbs to reveal the truth and retain a chance for you to survive the coming crisis.
<br>
<br>
Your first clue resides with Talia Sintache, a trusted friend who provided me with confidential information that helped me obtain the classified files now hidden away.
<br>
<br>
The moments we shared are few and far between now, but each holds a special place in my heart. Though my time is short, yours is not, so cherish it.
<br>
<br>
"The times woven into our lives are always cut in half, yet each thread continues to be integral to our identity. This fabric resides in each of us, a cornerstone of you, so even without their presence, everything still resides in your soul."
            <br>
            <br>
            Good Luck, Yours Truly.

                                    With each passing day, I grow a little more restless. As I look upon you, I realized that in your frantic pursuit for knowledge, you unknowingly scour a trough, expecting a miracle.

                                    For you, the darkness obscures all the secrets, yet you remain at the edge, too terrified to venture in, and even when the truth stands in front of you, you look past it, unable to see it. However, one day you may finally discover the truth, but that time has not come yet.

                                        You do not have long. Our time is severely limited. I was told if you are the one, you'll understand.

                                        To enter the truth, you require two parts to the puzzle you have yet to find. The answer of the first part lies where the words intersect. Once you align the letters, the first part is complete. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The second part is more sophisticated. I have entrusted this one to a different employee, but the second part ends with a three-digit number.

                                        The clues you seek are in place, but for one you must never follow. The abyss is infinite, there is no leaving. This person should have disappeared. The sky was once its home, a revered indivdual for their flight prowess. Tread carefully, this person is sly, do not be confused by their lies.

                                        Finding this person should take priority lest you step into their trap and disappearing forever.

                                        The clue entrusted to me: Once dedicated to the muses, a dangerous emperor sought destruction. Yet the glory of Alexandria has never been so breathtaking. It holds everything, yet if you are quiet enough, something cries out, hoping for freedom.

                                        Once both parts are in order, you will have a chance at the truth. Sintache's words hold truth. The first part of the second part lies in the message of the mastermind.

                                        I'll shed all pretenses, if you are the one to make it, you'll understand. The first part when unscrambled eludes to something far beyond for us to grasp. Even its gaze will strike fear into our hearts.

                            Today is the day. Cleansing Firmament is finally complete. It is set to launch in one hour, and once it does, the world will fall under my control. With its power, I will harvest Earth's resources to combat Abysim's dimensional army.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            DDA#001 Dimetiri has recognized the magnitude of Cleansing Firmament and is making every effort to hinder its launch. Just today, I narrowly escaped four assassination attempts. Fortunately, each was skillfully thwarted by Florendal.

                            <br>

                            This has to be my worst day ever.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            After consistently proving my loyalty to Founder Rothenal, I made a grave mistake. Under my supervision, a no-name employee managed to download a significant amount of confidential information from the Command Terminal. Although security tagged him with DDA#272 just before his escape, the damage was done. That bastard stole various plans, a collection of critical passwords, and, most alarmingly, data pertaining to Cleansing Firmament.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Upon analyzing his entry and exit records, it’s clear he had been planning this operation for weeks—perhaps even months. He chose the day of Founder Rothenal’s departure to Abysim, a calculated move that suggests this wasn’t a one-man operation. Someone must have helped him. But who?
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The situation is baffling, yet I have a strong suspicion about who his accomplice might be. If I act swiftly, I may be able to correct my mistake before Founder Rothenal discovers my failure.

                            As I had anticipated, DDA#001 Dimetiri has initiated its countermeasures, temporarily destroying the spatial gates and halting my ability to excavate resources from Abysim. Compounding the issue, an alarming number of Sakura Imaginations employees have fallen under its psychosis, leaving me temporarily unable to identify who among them is compromised.
                            <br>

                            On the brighter side, significant progress has been made on Cleansing Firmament. This development could turn the tide of this battle in my favor. With Cleansing Firmament, I will be able to harness Earth's resources and wield them to achieve my goals. However, I must remain patient and approach this endeavor with the utmost caution. Absolutely nothing about Cleansing Firmament can be revealed until every detail is in place.
                            <br>

                            As my company continues to expand, I have noticed a troubling increase in disloyalty among those within. My time is heavily consumed by the research of Abysim, leaving Sakura Imaginations frequently without a consistent source of leadership. To address this, I have formally appointed Amelia Florendal as my second-in-command. However, I still consider her untrustworthy and have equipped her with a Void Particle bracelet as a precaution against betrayal.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In other news, the presence of DDA#001, Dimetiri, has grown considerably despite the use of spatial destabilizers. This poses a severe challenge, as Dimetiri is aware of my plans to conquer Abysim. It knows the cards I hold, and yet I dread becoming the focus of its attention. Night after night, seeds of doubt and regret take root in my heart. I am no longer certain that I have made the right choices. But there is no turning back now. All that remains is to see if I emerge victorious in the end.

                            implementation and sale of Cleansing Soul is a success. It has a similar shape to a glock, with a futurisitic antennta at the end and a glossy white body. Inside of it contains a trace amount of DDA#343 Soleric Spores and DDA#384 Nihility Hibiscus. When used in extremely small portions, it can induce a person into a relaxed state while minimizing side effects when ingested individually.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Despite the product's success, generating nearly $300 million in revenue during its first year, our founder, Rothenal, identified significant flaws in our approach to its development and release.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            First, we were unable to provide a medical explanation for how the product worked without disclosing the existence of unprecedented dimensional ingredients. Second, this lack of transparency risked exposing that Sakura Imaginations possesses resources capable of near-miraculous effects, potentially triggering widespread envy and competition. Lastly, by releasing even small amounts of DDA#343 and DDA#384, we inadvertently revealed their existence to the world. This exposure increases the likelihood that other organizations will uncover the full extent of their capabilities.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In light of these vulnerabilities, we have devised a counter-strategy. However, its implementation may take decades. For now, we will lay low, allowing Sakura Imaginations to fade from public memory. In due time, we will reemerge under a new identity: Moonlit Solutions.

                            Through the various resources harvested from Abysim, Sakura Imaginations is now approaching the prototype stage of Cleansing Soul. At this time, the details of Cleansing Soul will remain undisclosed to avoid potential complications. However, we are planning to market it as a global product in the future.

                            On a different note, Founder Rothenal has successfully completed her spatial destabilizer. This device dampens DDA#001's ability to detect human presence but significantly increases the danger of traveling between Earth and Abysim. Over the past six months, three expeditions have been sent, of which two were lost due to the collapse of the spatial bridge before their return, leaving them trapped in Deorc.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Currently, there are no plans to initiate rescue operations, as doing so would require an excessive amount of resources. Furthermore, the space is heavily saturated with DDA#272 Void Particles, making it highly likely that both expeditions have been completely annihilated.

                            DDA#343: Soleric Spores. First encountered during our eleventh visit to Abysim. A brown crystal speckled with white spots everywhere. When shattered, tiny microscopic spores are released into the surrounding environment. An employee inhaled these spores once after stepping on the crystal. After a week, their body had become fully braindead, but when analyzing their body, endorphins, a natural painkiller released by your body, were found at nearly twenty times the normal level.

                            In other words, the employee was in constant pain, drowning his senses in a continuous flow of endorphins. This resulted in him becoming braindead after a week.

Initially unassuming, DDA#384 displayed alarming behavior upon contact. It attached itself to an employee's body, and over time, took complete control of the host's motor functions.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The progression was as follows: within the first few days, the employee experienced increasing difficulty with everyday movements. By the third day, motor functions were completely impaired. Five days later, DDA#384 had fully overtaken the host's body, erasing the employee's consciousness entirely.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <br>Eyewitness accounts report that the Reavers wield their forelegs as their primary weapons. These limbs possess a sharpness comparable to stainless steel knives but with an extraordinary property. When channeling their energy—marked by their eyes turning red—DDA#391 can cut through the fabric of space. This ability allows them to traverse great distances by slicing open a spatial rift, entering it, and emerging elsewhere within seconds.

DDA#272: Void Particle. First encountered during our fifth visit to Abysim, this anomaly appears as a purple and black floating ball composed of an unknown material. During the visit, an employee made contact with it. Initially, no immediate changes were observed, but a few days later, the employee experienced severe deterioration. Both of his arms were lost, and half of his head had disappeared. Despite being on the brink of death, he remained medically alive. However, the loss of his limbs and parts of his head left him unable to speak, see, and caused partial hearing loss. Contact with DDA#272 results in the subject's gradual disappearance over time.

Although Abysim remains unstable, further research indicate that travel between both dimensions is stabilizing. From this, I can transfer more energy and organic matter from Abysim.

I need to warp the space by stretching out the dimension, making it difficult for energy to traverse easily, could make it harder to detect human presence during the visits.

                            <br>
Abysim exists in a dimension beyond Earth, separated by a sub-dimension known as Deorc. Deorc is an enigmatic and perilous space, filled with undiscovered dangers. Multiple attempts to investigate Deorc have ended in devastating failure.
                            <br>
                            <br>
Rather than exploring Deorc directly, Sakura Imaginations utilizes a spatial bridge to focus on Abysim, a much more manageable dimension in comparison. Though casualties are extremely high with each expedition, Abysim offers new resources and miraculous discoveries. However, it is fiercely guarded by a powerful entity, DDA#001 Dimetiri, whose abilities remain largely unknown. It is theorized that Dimetiri is the very source of Abysim, and any attempt to conquer Abysim will require finding a way to neutralize Dimetiri.

"Tread carefully, Rothenal; the heavens have grown dim." These were the first words spoken to me as my hand made contact with Abysim for the first time. My heart raced uncontrollably, and I nearly fainted from the sheer intensity of the contact. For a brief moment, I saw a pitch-black pupil staring directly into me. I could feel its limitless strength, far beyond my current comprehension.
<br>
<br>
<br>Analysis:
DDA#001: Codenamed DIMETIRI, this entity can peer into our dimension, though its vision is severely limited. It can induce psychosis through dimensional barriers and likely generate hallucinations so vivid that they become nearly indistinguishable from reality. The full extent of its abilities remains undetermined. It is advised not to approach DIMETIRI under any circumstances. Death may not be the worst outcome in such an encounter.
<br>
<br>
To continue studying Abysim, I have founded Sakura Imaginations, aiming to raise capital and utilize the technology, innovations, and resources in a legal manner—for the time being.
