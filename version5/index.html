        Hi, I am so glad you made it! It must be terribly cold outside. You should stay near the fire to keep warm. By the time you read this, it should be Christmas Day, and regardless of whether or not you celebrate it, I want to wish you a Merry Christmas. Here’s to another productive and successful year.
        <br>
        <br>
        As for why you are here, I believe you are here for about 20 minutes of mystery (kinda), fun (not really), and filled with Christmas cheer (definitely not).
        <br>
        <br>
        Before I send you on your way, I need you to know a few things.
        <br>
        <br>
        First, despite planning this for quite some time now, I deeply regret leaving this to the side because creating this was a really fun project. It is definitely not as big as I had initially intended it to be, but I still hope you will find it even a little fun.
        <br>
        <br>
        Second, the industry-standard disclaimers: Any names, places, companies, or events are all made up and are not to be taken seriously in any way.
        <br>
        <br>
        EVERYTHING WAS MADE UP AND DOESN'T ACCURATELY REFLECT ANYTHING.
        <br>
        <br>
        Third, it can be a bit dark at times, but just a small bit.
        <br>
        <br>
        Lastly, I bug-fixed as much as I possibly could, but I may or may not have left some smaller things. If it breaks down HARD, then tell me, and I’ll fix it ASAP.
    </div>
    <div class="message-3">        
        Final things to note: Play this in fullscreen. I designed this fully for fullscreen, so if you don’t fullscreen, everything will be severely off.
        <br>
        <br>
        A lot of ideas were scarpped, due to time management issues and the fact that it was a lot more difficult to make then initially anticipated.
        <br>
        <br>
        If anyone still hasn’t caught on, Talia Sintache is an alt Discord account operated by me—not a real person. I only did it to add a little more immersion.
        <br>
        <br>
        Entirely up to you, but it can be a bit of a race. If you can't already tell, only four people have direct access to this. Let's see who is the first one to complete it.
        <br>
        <br>
        Ok, I think that will conclude my yap session. I hope everyone enjoys this, and good luck!
